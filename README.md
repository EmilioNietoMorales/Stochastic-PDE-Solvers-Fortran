# Numerical Simulations in Fortran

## Overview
This repository contains optimized numerical solvers for complex physical systems. The focus is on **computational efficiency** and **numerical stability**.

## Projects

### 1. Finite Difference PDE Solver (DiffusionEq)
* **Physics Context:** Simulation of the 1D Diffusion (Heat) Equation.


### 2. Monte Carlo Simulation (`/MonteCarlo`)
* **Physics Context:** Stochastic simulation of particle systems.
